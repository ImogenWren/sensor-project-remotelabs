# Sensors One - Backbone PCB - Power Supply 

## Description
The backbone PCB will provide all power requirements to the sensors One experiment. It will manage routing the PicoScope probes to defined pins on the backbone header, which will join the backbone PCB to the sensors one experiment PCB

## Power Requirements

### Sensors Experiment Power Requirements
_All power requirements for the **sensors-one-pcb** must be provided by **sensors-backbone-pcb**_

- Bi-polar supply for Op-Amps and similar (100mA per 5v rail (+-)? is this enough)
- Power for Fan (60mA @ 12v) - needs to be 5v
- Power for Bulb. (~60mA @ ~5v)

- #TODO: Any MCU required on experiment board?

### Backbone PCB Power Requirements
_Power Requirements for all hardware on **sensors-backbone-pcb**
- Embedded MCU (200mA max @ 5v)
- +5v for SBC. 3A specified.
- analog switch power requirements?
- any other board level hardware


## Power Distribution - sensors-backbone-pcb
_Detail suitable options for providing for each of the power requirements_

-(+-)5v will be provided using linear power regulators or similar.
- +5v for SBC will be provided via a buck converter capable of 3A output @ 5v 
- #TODO Design decision, adjustable buck or not? adjustable means power for odroid easy to set
- +5v for Arduino will be provided by another linear regulator
	

## Power Distro Parts Specification
_Specify specific solutions for each power requirement_

### (+-5v) Bi-Polar Supply for sensors-one-pcb - OPTION A
https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/dc-dc-converters/1227021
https://docs.rs-online.com/2f4c/0900766b8154511b.pdf
Specs:
- Vout 			= +-5v 
- Power Rating 	= 1W
- Iout(max) 	= 200mA (100mA per output)
- Vdropout		= n/a
- Package 		= SIP
- Vin(min)	 	= 4.5  (check datasheet - 12v and 24VDC in models available
- Vin(max) 		= 5.5 
- Efficiency 	= 83%
- Cost			= Â£4.01
- Inoload		= 20mA
Assuming 24VDC input and 200mA output = 5x0.2 = 1W, with efficiency this means: 50mA @ 24v

### +5v Regulator
### -5v Regulator
### Option B LDO
- JLCpart: C358376
Datasheet
https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/1912111437_Foshan-Blue-Rocket-Elec-79D05_C358376.pdf
Specs:
- Vout = 
- Vdropout =  1.4v
- Package = TO-252-2
- Vin(max) = ? -35 compared to output? so 30v? or -30v? real unclear. datasheet little help-
- Vin(min) = Vout +(-) Vdropout = -6.4v or 6.4v?

### Option C Linear Regulator

- JLCpart: 
Datasheet

Specs:
Vout =
- Vdropout =  1.4v
- Package = TO-252-2
- Vin(max) = ? -35 compared to output? so 30v? or -30v? real unclear. datasheet little help-
- Vin(min) = Vout +(-) Vdropout = -6.4v or 6.4v?	


###  Option D Negative Buck Converter
https://www.vishay.com/docs/76946/creatingnegativeoutputvoltage.pdf

### (+5v) Buck Converter for SBC
- Same as ISOpower board

Vin: 24VDC
Vout: 5vDC
Iout: 3A
Pout: 15W
Efficiency ~ 0.80
Pmax = Pout/0.80 = 18.75W
Iin =  18.75/24 = 0.78125 A 780.125mA

	
## Power Input Requirements to sensor-backbone-pcb
_Ensure that all specified hardware can be provided +24v, and calculate *Itotal* for 24v input_

For sensors-one-pcb:
- 50mA max @ 24v
For SBC
- 800mA max @ 24v
For everything else on sensors-backbone-pcb
